<p>For this piece, we had to watch a black and white film, take a frame from it and recreate it with a picture of ourselves and different textures.
      The movie I picked was Dr. Strangelove and I recreated a scene of him with a cigarette.
    The textures I used to do the shadings were found in an art magazine that I scanned in and used Photoshop to create the piece.

<p>I am going to Drexel University for User Experience & Interation Design.  I am in my second year of the program and I am enjoying it very much.  While I may not have the most experience so far, I want to specialize in making animated designs.  I want to work with a team with diverse baackgrounds and ideas so I can broaden my horizons and become a better designer.  Outside of school, I enjoy art, cosplay and boxing.</p>

  <p>This is a video that I made for my Interactive Digital Media as my final.
We had to take an app with design flaws and recreate it and improve upon its design.
Almost every asset seen in the video is of my design with the exception of the photos.</p>

<p>In this project I created several unique patterns and inserted them into a portrait of myself, we had to pose as a scene from a black and white movie of our choice, mine being Dr. Strangelove. </p>
